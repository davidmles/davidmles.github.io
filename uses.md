  Joining the trend of <a href="https://uses.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">/uses</a>, I list the gadgets and software I normally use on this page.

  I'm quite minimalist and prefer to use what solves my needs well enough rather than products with much more than what I need.

  <h2>General hardware</h2>

  - My main computer is a 2018 15" MacBook Pro.
  - I connect it via USB-C to a 4K 27" LG monitor, which also charges the battery.
  - I use an MX Master 3 mouse.
  - I type on an MX Keys keyboard.
  - My mobile phone is an iPhone 12 Mini. I don't change phones often. If it works for what I need it for, I keep it. I charge it wirelessly, which is very convenient.
  - After going through the original iPad and iPad 2, after many years, I now have a 2018 iPad Pro that we use at home, primarily for watching videos. My daughter uses an iPad Mini 4.
  - On my wrist, I wear an Apple Watch Series 4. It works great for me to follow the Pomodoro technique, track my workouts, control the volume of podcasts and videos, check the temperature, and so on.
  - I play on a Nintendo Switch for my moments of disconnection. I was a big Sega fan with a Megadrive in my pre-teen years back in the 90s, and since I miss that era, I prefer Nintendo now.

  <h2>Video hardware</h2>

  - I record my videos with the iPhone 12 Mini.
  - Elgato Key Light Air.

  <h2>Audio hardware</h2>

  - I have an Apple HomePod and a HomePod Mini to listen to music at home. They have excellent-quality sound.
  - I also have an Amazon Echo Dot that we use in the living room.
  - I use my AirPods 2 daily at home.
  - I use AirPods Pro (1st gen) while away from home.
  - I record voice-overs for my courses with an Apogee HypeMiC.

  <h2>General software</h2>

  - I use macOS as my operating system.
  - I mainly use Apple apps: Mail, Notes, Reminders, Calendar, Photos, Messages, Safari, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, and so on.
  - To get organized:
    - Things and Reminders for to-do lists.
    - MindNode for mind maps.
    - Project Office for Gantt charts.
    - Apple Notes to save my backlog.
  - I like 1Password to store all sensitive information.
  - In a corner, I have OpenEmu, to remember the old days playing beat 'em ups in real arcades.

  <h2>Development software</h2>

  - On servers, I use Linux as the operating system.
  - I use Visual Studio Code as my code editor. The font I use is Apple's SF Mono.
  - I use the system's default terminal app without any customization.
  - SourceTree is excellent for managing Git repositories.
  - For working with images, I use Pixelmator Pro, and for vectors, I use Logoist.

  <h2>Software for video courses</h2>

  - I record and edit screencasts with ScreenFlow.
  - I edit the camera recording in Apple Final Cut.
  - Sometimes, I do some animation with Apple Motion.
  - I process the audio with Apple Logic Pro.
