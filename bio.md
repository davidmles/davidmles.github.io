  Hi! I'm David Morales.

  **I'm a web developer and technical instructor** since 2000; and **a computer engineer** since 2005.

  I have developed several e-commerce sites, social networks, and classified ad sites from beginning to end.

  <h2>My story</h2>

  I was always impressed by 80’s computers, those green screens, and those big boxes. I loved IBM PCs and could imagine myself being a hacker using them.

  With my first computer in 1993, I started to learn to program. **I chose *Pascal* as my first programming language**, and it was exciting! **Soon I heard of a more widespread language called *C***, so I started to learn it. I found it more difficult. I remember that I always preferred *Pascal*, so I left *C* and returned to it many times. I made some little text-based video games with *Pascal* containing school stories my classmates liked.

  I even tried to develop an application for the mechanic in my neighborhood. **What I tried to build from scratch was a database!** He wanted to have a system to manage his customers and print invoices. I worked hard and accomplished storing data in binary files. It was driven by a rudimentary (but hey, very functional) user interface developed in plain-old *C for MS-DOS*.

  At 17, I built an app containing a digital magazine. **I developed a tool using *Borland Turbo C***, achieving a minimal executable size! It had a custom UI, supporting graphics and menu buttons, and pagination for the articles. **The program had 2000 lines of *C* code and some assembler**.

  **At 18, I decided to study computer science more seriously**. While learning *PHP* and making my first websites, I studied for a higher degree in programming. I learned a lot about databases, networks, and languages like *C++*.

  **In 2000 I started to work professionally as a web developer**, using *JavaScript* and *ASP*, and at the same time, I was teaching on-site.

  In 2001 I wanted to continue studying, so **I started a degree in Computer Science** at the University of Barcelona, which I completed in February 2005. There I learned the basics of computing: electronics, math, and software engineering. I even learned *Java* and *Ruby*!

  Since then, I have worked on several projects in startups, first using *PHP* with the *Symfony framework* and later *Ruby on Rails*.

  <h2>My experience as a web developer and teacher</h2>

  - I started in 2000 as a full-stack web developer, mainly using *ASP* and *JScript* (Microsoft’s *JavaScript* version). And I was combining it, in the same company, with web development classes on *ASP*, *PHP*, and *Java*. I also taught *Linux* system administration. I had students from the following companies and institutions: Ajuntament de Barcelona (Barcelona City Council), TMB (Barcelona Metropolitan Transport), FGC (Catalan Government Railways), Cirsa, Sony
  - In 2006 I developed an ecological social network called Tree-Nation, in *PHP*.
  - In 2008 I developed a classified ads website. I used the first version of the *Symfony framework* for *PHP*.
  - In 2010 I created another classified ads website, collaborating with several real estate portals in Spain. I also used the first version of *Symfony*.
  - In 2013 I jumped to *Symfony2* to develop a *PrestaShop* clone used in an e-commerce website.
  - At that time, I changed technology to *Ruby on Rails*. But before, I wanted to dump my knowledge of *Symfony2* in a course that I published on Udemy and had great acceptance. While learning *Ruby*, I developed a social network of activities similar to Meetup.
  - Since 2014 I have been working remotely for several companies in the UK, using *Ruby on Rails*.
  - In 2022 I started working on my first course for LinkedIn Learning. The experience of working with several teams to launch the course together has been gratifying.
  - In 2023, I started working at Spotlio as a tech lead for Ruby on Rails.

  <h2>My studies</h2>

  - Degree in Computer Science, Universitat de Barcelona, 2005. Capstone project: *Implementation of Bayesian Network Learning Algorithms* (contributing to Intel's open-source Probabilistic Networks Library).
    - Here, I stumbled upon mathematics applied to many fields. I learned a lot about logic, computer architecture, artificial intelligence and discovered the *Perl* and *Ruby* languages.
  - Associate's Degree in Development of Computer Applications, Escola del Treball de Barcelona, 2001.
    - Here I delved into databases, algorithms, and networking.
  - Vocational Training in Management Computing, Col·legi Cultural Badalona, 1999.
    - Here I discovered the basics of computer science, with languages as old as *IBM RPG* and *COBOL*.
